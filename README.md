# codementor-bugs
Unofficial issue tracker for https://codementor.io/

This is not a source code.
This is just a place to track issues of CM.

## History

I've contacted CM support asking why CM does not evolve and got the following response:

> It's great hearing from you, and thanks for your continued support for CM! While we have been making improvements to the platform since 2017, please know that most of the updates are on the mentee side. You can learn more about updates for both [mentees](https://updates.codementor.io/) and [mentors](https://mentor-updates.codementor.io/) via these links. 

> I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing some issues and glitches. Please know that we are always taking feedback and bug-reports, and will continue to work on improving the platform. Could you kindly elaborate what areas on our platform that you are finding difficulty with? For instance, it would be great if you can specify which parts are especially confusing or glitchy to you. This would help us better understand your experience and make improvements to the CM platform.

> Thanks again for the feedback, and I look forward to hearing from you!

I think there are more than a couple issues to report and I'm used to tracking issues in GitHub. So I'll be doing it here.
